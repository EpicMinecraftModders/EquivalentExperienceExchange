*For info on stuff in game check the wiki out.*
##What is EEE?##
This is Equivalent Exchange 2 (EE2) stuff for modern Minecraft. EE2 was created before the experience was in Minecraft (MC 1.2.5 latest for EE2) and is best known for being in the modpack Tekkit (now Tekkit Classic). 
##Why doesn't this work???###
This mod is in Alpha development right now. Nothing is final and stuff probably will change. When we get to a time where we think this mod is stable enought for release then we make help avaible.
##I had an idea for this mod? Can i help???##
Yes, but don't make a issue because you want something in this mod. We will make a official minecraft forums thread when this mod is ready for public use. 
##Can I join your team?##
Maybe, if you can show us that you can program real good and understand where the project is heading we will allow you to join.  
##Can i make a pull request for a feature I worked on?##
If it's a minor change please just make the pull request otherwise please discuss before hand the change. We wouldn't want to waste your efforts if we are not planning on moving EEE that way.
##Thiz modz is aesome :) canz i donate?!?!?!##
When this mod hits a major release we will setup the a donating system to help us fund other mods we had planned.
*This file is a work in progress. Come back soon...*
